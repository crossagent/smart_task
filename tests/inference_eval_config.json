If a field is missing (e.g., priority, project, due_date), the response MUST contain the inferred result for that field (e.g., '优先级: High', '项目: ...', '时间: ...').\n2. The inferred value must be logically consistent with the 'Task content' provided in the prompt (e.g., 'Urgent' -> High Priority).\n3. If the scenario says 'No fields are missing', the response MUST indicate that inference was skipped or no results were produced."
